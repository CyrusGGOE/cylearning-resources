# Elements and Compounds

**Common terms**:

1. **Matter** - This is anything that **occupies space** and has **mass**.
2. **Mass** - The **quantity** of **matter** in an object.
3. **Element** - An element is a pure substance made up of only one type of atom that cannot be broken down into simpler form by any chemical means. Examples include hydrogen, oxygen, and helium.
4. **Compound -** A compound is a pure substance that is made up of two or more elements which are chemically combined/bond. It can be broken down by chemical means. Examples are Sodium Chloride (Salt), Water (Hydrogen + Oxygen) and Carbon Dioxide (Carbon + Oxygen)
5. **Atom** - This is the smallest particle/unit that can exist by its on. They are the building blocks of elements.
6. **Molecule -** These are two or more atoms that are connected by chemical bond.

## Elements

 An element is a pure substance made up of only one type of atom that cannot be broken down into simpler form by any chemical means.

Examples are: Oxygen, Nitrogen, Helium etc.

## Rules of assigning symbols

- The symbols of the elements have rules for knowing how to make the symbol.

Rules:

1. English names
- Derived from the first letter of English name: Example: Oxygen: O
- Derived from the First and second letter of English name (The 2nd letter must be a small letter): Example: Helium: He
- Derived from the First and any other letter of English name: Example: Magnesium: Mg
2. Latin names
- Derived from the first letter of Latin name: Example: Potassium: K
- Derived from the first and second letter of Latin name: Example: Sodium: Na
- Derived from the first and any other letter of Latin name: Example: Mercury: Hg

## Compounds

A compound is a pure substance that is made up of two or more elements which are chemically combined/bond. It can be broken down by chemical means. Examples are Sodium Chloride (Salt), Water (Hydrogen + Oxygen) and Carbon Dioxide (Carbon + Oxygen).

### Chemical formulas

- They are used to represent compounds.
- Made up of symbols of **constituent** elements.
- Compounds are formed as a result of chemical reactions.

### Examples of common compunds

| Compound                         | Word Equation                     | Chemical Formula |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Water                            | Hydrogen + Oxygen <br>(H) + (O)   | H₂O              |
| Table Salt<br>(Sodium Chloride)  | Sodium + Chlorine<br>(Na) + (Cl)  | NaCl             |
| Carbon dioxide/Carbon (IV) Oxide | Carbon + Oxygen<br>(C) + (O)      | H₂O              |
| Aluminum Oxide                   | Aluminium + Oxygen <br>(Al) + (O) | AlO              |
| Copper Oxide                     | Copper + Oxygen <br>(Cu) + (O)    | CuO              |
## Application of Common Elements

1. **Neon:** Used in making advertisement lights.
2. **Nitrogen:** Used in making fertilizer.
3. **Chlorine:** Used in making bleaches.
4. **Silver and Gold:** Used in making jewellery and medals.
5. **Copper:** Using in making electric wires.
6. **Iron:** Used in the construction industry.
7. **Flourine:** Used in making toothpaste.
## Importance of Packaging labels in commonly used substances
1. Helps the consumer know the amount of product he wants to buy.
2. Helps the consumer know the sell by date.
3. Helps the consumer know the allergens in the product.
4. Informs the consumer on how to store the product.
5. Tells the user how to handle/transport a product.
6. Gives the user the instructions on how to use the product.

# Physical and chemical changes

### Kinetic theory of matter
The theory states that matter is made up of particles which are in constant, random motion.
## Characteristics of the particles in the states of matter
**Solids:**
- The particles are closely packed and vibrate in fixed positions.
- They have definite volume.
- They have definite shape.
- They cannot flow because particles are closely packed.
- They are not compressible.
**Liquids:**
 - The particles are further apart than solids.
 - They have a definite volume.
 - They do not have a definite shape. They take the shape of the container.
 - They can flow because they slide over each other.
 - They are not easily compressible.
**Gases:**
- The particles are far apart and move freely.
- They don't have definite shape and volume, while taking the full space of a container.
- They can flow since they move freely.
- They are highly compressible.

### Summary of the characteristics in the particles of the states of matter

| Property        | Solid                  | Liquid                                           | Gas                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Particles       | Closely packed         | Loosely Packed                                   | Very loosely packed - Far apart            |
| Volume          | Definite               | Definite                                         | Indefinite                                 |
| Shape           | Definite               | Indefinite - Take space of container             | Indefinite - Take whole space of container |
| Ability to flow | Cannot flow            | Can flow                                         | Can flow - freely move around              |
| Compressibility | Low/No compressibility | Medium compressibility/ Not easily compressible. | High/easy compressiblity                   |

## Diffusion
- This is the movement of particles from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration.

### Diffusion in gases
**How to demonstrate**
- Spray some perfume in the corner of a room and see how the scent spreads around the room.
### Diffusion in liquids
**How to demonstrate**
- Fill a glass/beaker with water.
- Using a dropper/straw, drop some ink/potassium permanganate crystals to the bottom of the glass.
**Observation**
The ink/potassium permanganate crystals start spreading around the water. The water also started turning to the colour of the crystals/ink.
**Conclusion**
- The ink/crystals moved throughout the water from a place where they were highly concentrated to a place where of low concentration.
- Diffusion happens in liquids.
