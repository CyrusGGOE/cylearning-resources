# Soil Pollution

## What is soil pollution?

- Soil pollution is the contamination of soil with harmful substances.
- The harmful substances are known as pollutants or contaminants.

## What are the causes of soil pollution?

- Excess use of artificial fertilizers:
    - Fertilizers add heavy metals to the soil.
    - This makes the soil toxic and harmful to crops.
- Excess use of agricultural chemicals:
    - Using too much pesticides and herbicides can accumulate and become pollutatns.
    - This will become toxic to organisms in the soil.
- Throwing plastic wastes in the garden:
    - Plastic cannot be broken down by soil living organisms.
    - As a result, they interfere with the growing crops and reduce agricultural space.
- Throwing chemical containers:
    - Chemical leftovers can get inside the soil.
    - This causes them to be pollutants.
- Surface runoff carrying contaminated water.
- Industrial waste:
    - Dangerous chemicals and substances are disposed in the soil.
    - This affects soil micro-organisms and makes the soil contaminated.

**Summary:**

- Soil pollution is the contamination of soil through harmful substances known as pollutants.
- Cause of these are:
    - Excess use of artificial fertilizers.
    - Excess use of agricultural chemicals.
    - Throwing plastic wastes in the garden.
    - Throwing chemical containers.
    - Surface runoff carrying contaminated water.
    - Industrial waste.

**Questions**

1. Write the meaning of soil pollution.
2. Write down 5 causes of soil pollution.

**Answer these before moving on.**

## What are the effects of soil pollution?

1. Production of crops that are not safe for consumption.
2. It affects the soil fertility and soil PH.
    - It affects agricultural production leading to food insecurity.

## How can we prevent/control soil pollution?

1. Practicing organic farming.
2. Use of the correct type and amount of fertilizer.
3. Practicing safe disposal of plastic wastes.
4. Planting trees and cover crops to reduce surface runoff.
5. Recycling and reusing plastic containers.
6. Recycling waste materials to use for other purposes.

## How can we create awareness on Prevention on Soil Pollution in Farming?

We can create awareness on Prevention on Soil Pollution in Farming by:

- Posters
- Dramatization
- Songs
- Poems

**Summary:**

- The effects of soil pollution are:
    1. Production of crops that are not safe for consumption.
    2. It affects the soil fertility and soil PH.
        - It affects agricultural production leading to food insecurity.
- The ways we can prevent soil pollution are:
    1. Practicing organic farming.
