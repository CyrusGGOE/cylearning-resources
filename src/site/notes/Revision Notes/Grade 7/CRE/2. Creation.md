# Accounts of Creation

- In the Bible, we have two accounts of creation.
- The first account of creation is located in Genesis 1-2:4a.
- The second account of creation is located at Genesis 2:4a-25.

## The first account of Creation
- Before creation, the earth was formless and desolate.
- On the first day of Creation, God created Light and separated the light from the darkness.
- On the second day of Creation, He made the Sky/Dome to divide the water and keep it in two separate places.
- On the third day of Creation, He made Land and Sea, and made the Earth produce all kinds of plant, those that bear grain and fruit.
- On the forth day of Creation, he created the sun to rule over the day and the moon to rule over the night. He also made the stars.
- On the fifth day of Creation, He created the sea creatures and birds.
- On the sixth day of Creation, He created human beings, male and female.
- On the seventh day, God rested.

## The second account of Creation
 - After God made the universe, there was no one to take for it.
 - God created a man out of soil and breathed life into his nostrils.
 - Afterwards, God planted the Garden of Eden and made all kinds of trees to grow there, including the tree of Knowledge that gives knowledge of what is good and bad.
 - There were 4 rivers in the garden of Eden:
	 - Pishon (The gold river)
	 - Gihon
	 - Tigris
	 - Euphrates
- God placed the man in the garden of Eden to cultivate and guard it.
- He told him not to eat the tree of knowledge or else, he will die the same day.
- God created animals and birds and brought them to the man to name them.
