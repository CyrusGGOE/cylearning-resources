## Parts of a poem

1. **Stanza:** A group of lines in a poem. Its is also called a verse.

### Things to consider in a poem
1. **Persona:** This is the person/animal in the poem who is speaking.
2. **Author:** This is the person who made the poem.
3. **Theme:** This is the main idea of the poem. Often found in the title or the line in the end that repeats.
4. **Structure:** This is how the poem is organized. Consider the stanzas, lines and line breaks.
5. **Rhyming words:** These are the words at the end of the line that rhyme with each other. Example: Wings, swings.
## Stylistic devices used in a poem

1. **Personification** - This is when non-human things(objects, plants and animals) are given human attributes. Example: The door shouted at me, The wind whistled to the horizon.
2.  **Repetition** - This is when certain words are repeated in the poem. Example: He wrote, wrote and wrote.
3. **Similes:** - These are direct comparisons using the word 'as', often used to compare someone/something with a certain attribute or character. Example: As white as snow, as brave as a lion.
4. **Metaphors:** A direct comparison, not using words like 'as' to compare. Example: He is a lion meaning he is as brave as a lion.
5. **Proverbs:** Words used to give advice, often having hidden meaning. Example: Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
	Note: Proverb is not a major one so its best to write it as an answer after the strong points.
6. **Alliteration:** Repetition of the initial consonant sound, often used in tongue twisters. Example: Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
7. **Imagery:** The use of words to convey a picture in someone's mind. Examples: Look at the crystal clear rivers, the sun shading pink in the sky.
8. **Hyperbole:** Exaggeration of actions. Example: She spoke a million words in a second.
